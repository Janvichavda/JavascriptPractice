    <h1>Hoisting</h1>
    <p>
        Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their
        containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use
        variables and functions in your code even before they are declared. However, it's important to note that only
        the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.</p>

    <p>1). Variable Hoisting:
        When a variable is declared using var, it is hoisted to the top of its scope, and its declaration is moved to
        the top of the function or global scope. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the initialization. If a
        variable is used before it is declared, it will have the value undefined.
    </p>
    <p>

        2)Function Hoisting:
        Function declarations are hoisted entirely, including both the function name and its body. This means you can
        call a function before its actual declaration in the code.

    <script>

        console.log(x); // undefined
        var x;

        sayHello(); // "Hello, world!"
        function sayHello() {
            console.log("Hello, world!");
        }

        // This will not work because the variable declaration is hoisted,
        // but the function assignment is not.

        // sayHello(); // TypeError: sayHello is not a function
        // var sayHello = function () {
        //     console.log("Hello, world!");
        // };

    </script>
