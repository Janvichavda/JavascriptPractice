                1) What is the difference between HTML elements and tags?
                <p>

                    Ans.) HTML elements communicate to the browser to render text. When the elements are enclosed by
                    brackets
                    <>,
                        they
                        form HTML tags. Most of the time, tags come in a pair and surround content.

                <br>
                Ans.) Logical tags are used to tell the meaning of the enclosed text. The example of the
                logical tag is < strong>
                    < /strong> tag. When we enclose the text in the strong tag, it tells the browser
                        that enclosed text is
                        more important than other texts.
                        <br>
                        Physical tags are used to tell the browser how to display the text enclosed
                        in the physical tag.
                        Some of the examples of physical tags are < b>, < big>, < i>.
